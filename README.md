# Project Description


The presented project on Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection using Quantum Transfer
Learning (QTL) offers a significant advancement in the field of medical diagnostics by
integrating quantum computing with classical machine learning models. Through the
innovative combination of pre-trained classical feature extractors such as ResNet-18,
ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152, and Inception V3, with a Variational
Quantum Classifier, this project demonstrates a notable improvement in DR detection
accuracy, achieving a superior accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, the implementation of U-Net
for DR stage segmentation on the STARE dataset underscores the modelâ€™s high
effectiveness, achieving a testing accuracy of 96.94%. Complementary classical models, such
as SVM and KNN, also delivered robust results with accuracies exceeding 96.62%. The
novelty of this research lies in the hybridization of quantum and classical techniques, which
not only enhances diagnostic performance but also reduces computational complexity
compared to purely classical approaches. However, challenges were encountered in
optimising quantum circuits for complex datasets and navigating the computational
constraints of current quantum hardware. Additionally, the limited availability of diverse
DR datasets posed limitations on broader generalisation. Despite these challenges, the
findings of this research pave the way for future exploration into quantum-assisted medical
applications, marking a promising step toward more efficient and accurate healthcare
solutions
